Add risk classification and approval gates for outbound actions (creating issues, sending emails, posting messages, etc.) so that every external side effect goes through a policy check before execution. The model: every action declares a risk level (`read` / `write` / `danger`), a policy cascade resolves whether to `allow`, `require_approval`, or `deny`, and every invocation is logged with full audit trail.

## Problem

Agent-ops currently has **no policy layer** between "agent decides to do something" and "side effect happens." When a session agent creates a GitHub issue via `pushEntity('issue', data)`, or when the orchestrator sends a Telegram message, the operation executes immediately with no:

- **Risk assessment** — Is creating an issue safe? Is sending an email risky? Is deleting a branch dangerous? All operations are treated equally.
- **Human approval** — No way for a user to say "let the agent read repos freely, but ask me before creating PRs."
- **Audit trail** — No record of what external operations the agent performed, when, or with what parameters. If an agent sends 50 emails, there's no log.
- **Org-level policy** — An org admin cannot restrict what integrations their agents can use or what operations they can perform.
- **Rate limiting** — No per-action or per-service rate limits. An agent could spam an external API.

### What this means for wholesale deployment

Deploying agent-ops to organizations means agents act on behalf of employees. An agent that can silently create GitHub issues, send emails, post Slack messages, or modify calendar events without oversight is a liability. Organizations need:

1. Clear visibility into what agents are doing with external services
2. Ability to require approval for high-risk operations
3. Ability to deny dangerous operations entirely
4. Audit logs for compliance

### Current state of outbound operations

| Operation | Where It Happens | Policy Check | Audit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create GitHub issue | `GitHubIntegration.pushEntity()` | None | None |
| Create GitHub comment | `GitHubIntegration.pushEntity()` | None | None |
| Create GitHub PR | `routes/repos.ts` POST `/api/repos/pull-request` | None (auth only) | None |
| Send email | `GmailIntegration.pushEntity()` | None | None |
| Create calendar event | `GoogleCalendarIntegration.pushEntity()` | None | None |
| Send Telegram message | `services/telegram.ts` | None | None |
| Notify session DO | `services/webhooks.ts` | None | None |

## Design

### Risk Levels

Every action definition (from bean cp7w) declares a risk level:

```typescript
export type RiskLevel = 'read' | 'write' | 'danger';
```

| Risk | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | Retrieves data, no side effects | List repos, get issue, fetch calendar events |
| `write` | Creates or modifies external state | Create issue, send email, update event, post message |
| `danger` | Destructive or hard-to-reverse | Delete branch, close PR, remove team member, purge messages |

Risk is declared at the action definition level:

```typescript
// In actions/github/definitions.ts
{
  id: 'github.create_issue',
  risk: 'write',
  // ...
}

{
  id: 'github.delete_branch',
  risk: 'danger',
  // ...
}

{
  id: 'github.list_repos',
  risk: 'read',
  // ...
}
```

### Three-Mode Permission Cascade

For each action invocation, the system resolves an execution mode:

```typescript
export type ActionMode = 'allow' | 'require_approval' | 'deny';
```

Resolution order (first match wins):

1. **Per-action override** — The org or user has set a specific mode for this exact action ID (e.g., `github.create_issue` → `require_approval`).
2. **Per-service override** — The org or user has set a mode for all actions from this service (e.g., all `gmail.*` → `require_approval`).
3. **Per-automation override** — The workflow/session has a mode set for unattended execution (e.g., workflow runs → `allow` for `write`, `deny` for `danger`).
4. **Org default** — The org has a default mode per risk level.
5. **System default** — Inferred from risk level:
   - `read` → `allow`
   - `write` → `require_approval`
   - `danger` → `deny`

### Policy Storage

#### `action_policies` D1 Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE action_policies (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  org_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  scope TEXT NOT NULL,            -- 'action' | 'service' | 'risk_level'
  scope_value TEXT NOT NULL,      -- action ID, service name, or risk level
  mode TEXT NOT NULL,             -- 'allow' | 'require_approval' | 'deny'
  created_by TEXT NOT NULL,       -- userId of admin who set this
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  UNIQUE(org_id, scope, scope_value)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_action_policies_org ON action_policies(org_id);
```

Example rows:
```
| org_id | scope       | scope_value          | mode             |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|------------------|
| org1   | action      | github.create_issue  | allow            |
| org1   | service     | gmail                | require_approval |
| org1   | risk_level  | danger               | deny             |
```

### Action Invocations (Audit Trail)

#### `action_invocations` D1 Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE action_invocations (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  action_id TEXT NOT NULL,             -- e.g., 'github.create_issue'
  service TEXT NOT NULL,               -- e.g., 'github'
  risk TEXT NOT NULL,                  -- 'read' | 'write' | 'danger'
  resolved_mode TEXT NOT NULL,         -- 'allow' | 'require_approval' | 'deny'
  status TEXT NOT NULL,                -- 'pending_approval' | 'approved' | 'denied' | 'executing' | 'completed' | 'failed'

  -- Context
  session_id TEXT,                     -- which session triggered this
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,               -- on behalf of whom
  org_id TEXT,

  -- Parameters (redacted for sensitive fields)
  params TEXT,                         -- JSON of action parameters (may be truncated)

  -- Result
  result TEXT,                         -- JSON of action result (may be truncated)
  error TEXT,                          -- Error message if failed

  -- Approval
  approved_by TEXT,                    -- userId of approver (null if auto-allowed)
  approved_at TEXT,
  denied_by TEXT,
  denied_at TEXT,
  denial_reason TEXT,

  -- Timestamps
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  started_at TEXT,
  completed_at TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX idx_action_invocations_session ON action_invocations(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_action_invocations_user ON action_invocations(user_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_action_invocations_status ON action_invocations(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_action_invocations_org ON action_invocations(org_id, created_at);
```

### Action Service

```typescript
// packages/worker/src/services/actions.ts

export interface InvokeActionParams {
  actionId: string;            // e.g., 'github.create_issue'
  params: Record<string, unknown>;
  sessionId?: string;
  userId: string;
  orgId?: string;
}

export interface InvokeActionResult {
  invocationId: string;
  status: 'approved' | 'pending_approval' | 'denied';
  result?: unknown;            // Only present if status is 'approved' and execution completed
  error?: string;
}

/**
 * Entry point for all outbound actions.
 * 1. Look up action definition
 * 2. Resolve mode from policy cascade
 * 3. Create invocation row
 * 4. Execute, gate, or deny
 */
export async function invokeAction(
  env: Env,
  params: InvokeActionParams,
): Promise<InvokeActionResult>;

/**
 * Approve a pending action invocation.
 * Called by a user via the UI or API.
 */
export async function approveAction(
  env: Env,
  invocationId: string,
  approvedBy: string,
): Promise<InvokeActionResult>;

/**
 * Deny a pending action invocation.
 */
export async function denyAction(
  env: Env,
  invocationId: string,
  deniedBy: string,
  reason?: string,
): Promise<void>;
```

### Invocation Lifecycle

```
invokeAction()
  │
  ├─ Look up action definition from actionRegistry
  │  └─ Not found? → throw ValidationError
  │
  ├─ Resolve mode from policy cascade
  │  ├─ Per-action override?  → use it
  │  ├─ Per-service override? → use it
  │  ├─ Org default for risk? → use it
  │  └─ System default        → read=allow, write=require_approval, danger=deny
  │
  ├─ Create invocation row (status based on mode)
  │  ├─ allow           → status='approved'
  │  ├─ require_approval → status='pending_approval'
  │  └─ deny            → status='denied'
  │
  ├─ If denied:
  │  └─ Return { status: 'denied' }
  │
  ├─ If pending_approval:
  │  ├─ Notify user via session WebSocket (question-like UI)
  │  └─ Return { status: 'pending_approval', invocationId }
  │    (caller polls or waits for WebSocket notification)
  │
  └─ If approved (immediate or after approval):
     ├─ Resolve credential via getCredential() (bean tk3n)
     ├─ Update status → 'executing'
     ├─ Call action.execute(params, { token, ... })
     ├─ Update status → 'completed' or 'failed'
     └─ Return { status: 'approved', result }
```

### Approval UX

When an action requires approval, the session's UI needs to present it. This integrates with the existing question/prompt system:

1. **Action invocation with `pending_approval` status** → push event to session WebSocket
2. **Client renders approval card** in the chat stream (similar to question prompt)
3. **User clicks Approve/Deny** → calls `POST /api/actions/:id/approve` or `/deny`
4. **Action executes** → result pushed to chat stream

For Telegram/Slack channels, the approval prompt is sent as a message with inline buttons.

### API Routes

```
POST   /api/actions/invoke              — Invoke an action
POST   /api/actions/:id/approve         — Approve a pending action
POST   /api/actions/:id/deny            — Deny a pending action
GET    /api/actions/:id                  — Get invocation details
GET    /api/sessions/:id/actions         — List actions for a session
GET    /api/admin/actions                — List all actions (admin, with filters)
GET    /api/admin/action-policies        — List org action policies
PUT    /api/admin/action-policies        — Set/update an action policy
DELETE /api/admin/action-policies/:id    — Remove an action policy
```

### How the Agent Invokes Actions

The session agent (via Runner → OpenCode) needs a way to invoke actions. Two options:

**Option A: OpenCode custom tool.** Define a `run_action` tool in the OpenCode configuration that calls the worker API:

```json
{
  "name": "run_action",
  "description": "Execute an external action (create issue, send email, etc.)",
  "parameters": {
    "action_id": "string",
    "params": "object"
  }
}
```

The tool implementation in Runner calls `POST /api/actions/invoke` on the worker. If the action requires approval, the tool returns a "waiting for approval" message and the agent waits.

**Option B: Runner dispatches via DO.** Runner sends an `action_invoke` message over its WebSocket to SessionAgentDO, which calls the action service internally.

Option A is simpler and doesn't require DO changes. Option B has lower latency but couples the action system to the DO.

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Schema and service

1. Create D1 migrations for `action_policies` and `action_invocations` tables
2. Create `services/actions.ts` with `invokeAction()`, `approveAction()`, `denyAction()`
3. Create `services/action-policy.ts` with `resolveMode()` policy cascade
4. Add Drizzle schema definitions

### Phase 2: API routes

1. Create `routes/actions.ts` with invocation and approval endpoints
2. Add admin policy management to `routes/admin.ts`
3. Wire routes into `index.ts`

### Phase 3: Integrate with action definitions

Once action definitions exist (from bean cp7w), update `invokeAction()` to:
1. Look up the action definition from the registry
2. Validate params against the Zod schema
3. Use the declared risk level for policy resolution

### Phase 4: Agent integration

1. Add `run_action` OpenCode custom tool definition
2. Update Runner to handle action invocation responses (including pending approval)
3. Add approval prompt rendering in session chat UI

### Phase 5: Channel-specific approval UX

1. Telegram: send approval prompt as inline keyboard buttons
2. Slack (future): send approval prompt as Block Kit interactive message
3. Web: render approval card in chat stream (similar to question prompt)

## Relationship to Other Beans

- **agent-ops-tk3n (Unified Credential Boundary)** — Prerequisite. `invokeAction()` calls `getCredential()` to resolve credentials before executing an approved action.
- **agent-ops-cp7w (Control Plane / Execution Plane Split)** — Prerequisite (partially). Action definitions with typed params and risk levels come from the action plane defined in that bean. The policy service consumes the risk level from action definitions.
- **agent-ops-pa5m (Polymorphic Action Sources)** — The action service defined here becomes the execution engine that polymorphic action sources feed into. Whether the action comes from a static provider adapter or a dynamic MCP connector, it goes through the same policy gate.
- **agent-ops-wh8d (Durable Webhook Inbox)** — Webhook-triggered actions (e.g., "on PR opened, create Linear ticket") flow from the inbox processor through the action service, respecting policies.
- **agent-ops-ch4t (Pluggable Channel Transports)** — Explicit agent actions from channel packages (e.g., `telegram.pin_message`) go through the policy gate like any other action. The bidirectional messaging path (system-routed replies) does NOT go through the policy gate — it's a system operation, not an agent-initiated action. Approval prompts need per-channel rendering (inline keyboard for Telegram, Block Kit for Slack).

## Open Questions

1. **Approval timeout.** How long does a `pending_approval` action wait? If the user doesn't respond in 30 minutes, should it auto-deny? Auto-expire? The agent is blocked waiting.

2. **Batch approval.** If an agent wants to create 10 GitHub issues, does each one require individual approval? Or can the user approve "create issues in repo X" as a blanket grant for the session?

3. **Read action logging.** Should `read` actions (which default to `allow`) be logged in `action_invocations`? Full logging provides audit trail but could be noisy (every repo list, every issue fetch). Options: log all, log only write+danger, configurable per org.

4. **Offline approval.** If the user is not connected to the session when an action requires approval, how is we notify them? Push notification? Email? Or just wait until they reconnect?

5. **Policy inheritance.** If an org sets `gmail.*` → `deny`, can a specific user override this to `allow`? Or are org policies absolute? Recommendation: start with org-only policies (no per-user overrides) for simplicity. Per-user overrides add a combinatorial explosion to policy resolution.
